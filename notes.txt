✅ What relationship is this?

In your Product entity:

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "category_id")
private Category category;


This means:

Many Products belong to One Category

➡️ Many-to-One relationship (Product → Category)

✅ Real-life meaning (very clear)

Example:

Category = "Electronics"

Products inside it:

iPhone

Laptop

Headphones

Charger

So:

One category can have many products

But each product can have only one category

✅ How it looks in Database (Tables)
categories table
category_id	category_name
1	Electronics
2	Fashion
product table
product_id	product_name	category_id
10	iPhone	1
11	Laptop	1
12	Shirt	2

So the column:

@JoinColumn(name = "category_id")


creates a foreign key in Product table.

✅ product.category_id references categories.category_id

✅ Relationship Direction: Unidirectional

Right now, only Product knows about Category:

Product → Category ✅

Category → Products ❌ (not present)

So this relationship is unidirectional.

If you want Bidirectional relationship (optional)

If you want Category also to know which products it has, add this in Category:

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "category", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();


Then it becomes:

✅ Category ↔ Products (Bidirectional)

Summary

✅ Your relationship is:

Product (Many) → Category (One)

and DB wise:

Product table contains category_id as foreign key.
